INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------

Just drop the CreeperHeal.jar in your plugins folder, and the configuration file will be automatically generated. Or you can download the sample one with explanations on bukkit.



------------------------------------------------------
CONFIGURATION
------------------------------------------------------

wait-before-heal-explosions : 
(in seconds) Delay after the explosion before the damage gets repaired (or starts getting repaired for block per block).

wait-before-heal-fire : 
(in seconds) Delay after a block is destroyed by fire (burnt), before it gets replaced.

replacement-method : 
(block-per-block or all-at-once) Whether the blocks destroyed by the explosions should all pop back at once, or one at a time.
Cannot be changed on the go, you have to reload or restart the server to take the changes in account.

block-per-block-interval : 
(in ticks (1/20th of a second)) Delay between each block replacement (ie. set it to 10 for 2 blocks per second)

overwrite-blocks :
(true or false) Whether block replacement overwrites existing terrain.

drop-overwritten-blocks : 
(true or false) If overwrite-blocks is set to true, whether to drop the overwritten blocks' resources.
If it is set to false, whether to drop the block-to-be-replaced resource.

drop-destroyed-blocks : 
(true or false) Whether blacklisted blocks should drop items as with a normal explosion, configurable with a chance.

drop-destroyed-blocks-chance : 
(0 - 100) If setting above is true, chance that the block resource drops.

teleport-when-buried : 
(true or false) If a player is caught in an explosion being healed and is suffocating, teleport him above to safety.

verbose-level : 
(0 - 5) Amount of plugin messages shown. 1 is recommended, higher is for debugging purposes.

op-have-all-permissions : 
(true or false) OP are treated as admins by the plugin.

crack-destroyed-bricks : 
(true or false) Whether bricks destroyed should be replaced as cracked ones.

chest-protection: 
(no, lwc, lockette or all) no: nothing particular. lwc: blocks protected by lwc will not blow up. lockette: blocks protected by lockette will not blow up
all: no chest (or anything with an inventory) will blow up 

prevent-block-fall:
(true or false) If set to true, gravel/sand that should drop because the block beneath them has been destroyed don't. That ensures perfect terrain replacement.


Per world :

- Creepers : (true or false) replace damage done by creepers exploding.

- TNT : (true or false) same for TNT.

- Ghast : (true or false) same for ghast fireballs.

- Magical : (true or false) same for explosions from other sources (other plugins?).

- Fire : (true or false) replace damage done by fire.

- restrict-blocks : (false, whitelist or blacklist) Set to false to replace all blocks, whitelist to replace only the blocks defined in the whitelist, or blacklist to ignore those defined in the blacklist.

- restrict-list : (list of block ID separated by commas) whitelist (or blacklist, depending on the setting above)
		For example, to block dirt, all types of wool, normal logs and birch logs : 3, 35, 17:0, 17:2  (with restrict-blocks set to blacklist)

- replace-all-tnt : (true or false) Whether exploding TNT should be replaced or not, giving unlimited TNT to everyone.

- replace-above-limit-only : (true or false) Replace TNT damage only above the limit defined in replace-limit. Useful for allowing TNT mining, but preserving houses.

- replace-limit : (0-128) Level above which to replace TNT damage, if replace-above-only is set to true 

- block-enderman-pickup : prevent Endermen from picking up blocks.




------------------------------------------------------
TRAPS
------------------------------------------------------

Traps are TNT blocks that are automatically replaced along with their explosion's damage. Thus, the trap is reset. It allows for hidden TNT behind a wall, or pressure plates under the snow... Feel free to experiment!

1. Set up a trap.

Set a TNT block wherever you want. Look at it and type "/ch trap create". You should have sufficient permission for that (either of those nodes : CreeperHeal.* CreeperHeal.trap.* CreeperHeal.trap.create). Now, whenever this block explodes, it will pop back along with the rest of the blocks destroyed. And it is protected from getting destroyed by angry players!

2. Remove a trap.

If you are the owner of a trap, it's simple. Either look at it and type "/ch trap remove" or simply destroy it! You should of course have at least the node CreeperHeal.trap.remove.own, or CreeperHeal.trap.remove.all, or any of the wildcard (*) nodes.
If you're not the owner of the block, same procedure, but not the same permissions. This time you HAVE to have CreeperHeal.trap.remove.all, or any of the wildcard nodes.
